# pico-display-colour-change
A pico app using Pimoroni's display pack

![demo gif](/doc/images/pico3.gif)

This is a sample app that changes the colour of the screen pen and RGB LED randomly.

Duration between changes can be tweaked with the B and Y keys.

## Before you start

It's easier if you make a `pico` directory or similar in which you keep the SDK, Pimoroni Libraries and your projects alongside each other. This makes it easier to include libraries.

## Preparing your build environment

Install build requirements:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential
```

And the Pico SDK:

```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
export PICO_SDK_PATH=`pwd`
cd ../
```

The `PICO_SDK_PATH` set above will only last the duration of your session.

You should should ensure your `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set by `~/.profile`:

```
export PICO_SDK_PATH="/path/to/pico-sdk"
```

## Grab the Pimoroni libraries

```
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico
```

If you have not or don't want to set `PICO_SDK_PATH` you can edit `.vscode/settings.json` to pass the path directly to CMake.

## Prepare Visual Studio Code

Open VS Code and hit `Ctrl+Shift+P`.

Type `Install` and select `Extensions: Install Extensions`.

Make sure you install:

1. C/C++
2. CMake
3. CMake Tools
4. Cortex-Debug (optional: for debugging via a Picoprobe or Pi GPIO)
5. Markdown All in One (recommended: for preparing your own README.md)
